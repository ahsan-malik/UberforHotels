# Abstract / Introduction
This app allows a user to easily find a suitable hotel room for stay and can be called as Uber for hotels. Hotels can make their rooms available for people to stay. Similarly, if someone visits a city then he/she can use the app to see the available hotel rooms (and their features) within 5 KM diameter from its current location. The user can reserve a hotel room through the app. The hotel management can check in the user who has reserved a room and later check him/her out.The option of advanced reservation is not available in the app and the user has to check in the hotel room on the same date he/she has reserved it.Finally, a user will be asked to rate the hotel and the hotel room and similarly hotel management will rate the user.
